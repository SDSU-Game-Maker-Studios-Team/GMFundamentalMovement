Everything produced will be stored in a library-like structure
Github will be formatted as such:
/Current_Project/ construction zone, everything currently being worked on
/Previous_Versions/ storage of projects finished, tucked away for easy access
/Sprite_Library/ all art/bgs/objects/ categorized by character & type ie: walking animation, jumping, idle, ect.
/Step_Code_Library/ code templates for easy access, ie: generic movement character or monster AI code
/Code_Exchange/ this is like dynamic memory, when someone wants to access someone’s temporary changes to code, it would be much easier to paste their code/parts in a .txt here and then that code can be edited, manipulated and added to Current_Project by anyone else. This is better than completely re-downloading someone’s new project all together.
The goal is ease of access to backups, templates, and temporary changes
